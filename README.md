## Funnies

Read your favorite Web Comics in one spot, just like a Newspaper.

### Why?

I love reading my web comics every week. In real life I have a newspaper with it all in one section.
Why not online? RSS Feeds are usually useless because you have to separartely go to each page for updates.

### Requirements

Ruby 1.9.2-p136 (I live dangerously on the edge)
Ruby on Rails 3.0.4
PostgreSQL Database (this can be changed, see the database.example.yml)
Nokogiri Gem (scrapes all the comic image data)

### Deployment locations

Staging: [Heroku](http://funnies.heroku.com)

Production: [Linode](http://funniesapp.com)

### Production Stack

Funnies runs on a Linode 512 out of Dallas (more central location)

OS: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (I like apt and pkgsrc)
App Server: nginx (with passenger)
Database: PostgreSQL

### Contribute:

I publicly storyboarded this app at [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/201253)
Any issues can be reported to the [Github Issues Tracker](https://github.com/martinisoft/funnies/issues)

Any design help would be *awesome*

### Thanks:
